# ATM-machine

Description:

This is a web application that allows you to add or subtract from a total value and is respresented as an ATM machine that allows you to deposit and withdraw from a total account balance.

How to Run:

- go to https://github.com/rithvik1139/ATM-machine
- copy git repository
- open standalone.html file in web browser

Future Improvements:

The next step in this repository would be to add additional functionality to the ATM Machine perhaps utilizing a number pad instead of the number input field. Other improvements could include adding validation so that a user cannot withdraw more money than the account balance or requiring users to select deposit/withdraw before there is a visible input field.
